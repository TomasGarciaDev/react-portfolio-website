          I am an enthusiastic and proactive Full-Stack developer and Musician. I love teamwork synergies, and I work hard to get a good job done while building a fun and healthy working environment. I use my experience as a musician to feed my work as a Developer, skills I consistently apply in teamwork settings.
  I trained as a coder at Makers Academy, Europeâ€™s #1 Developer Bootcamp. I started as an eager amateur coder; this led me to win a Full Scholarship at Makers Academy. These intensive 16 weeks of Full-Stack training helped me become a competent and confident Developer.
  I highly enjoy and love the continuous growth aspect of a tech career. My main goal is to grow my knowledge as a Full-Stack Developer because I also love working with React and helping make my clients and companies thrive.
